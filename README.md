# Jaynes Cumming Model Project
Final project for Professor Wise's Computational Physics course.

### Note for working with GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks
When working with Jupyter notebooks and github, keep in mind that it will upload your current saved kernal. If you have an output such as the text printed when running the QuTip test, you do not want to push this to main. But, if you edit the code and would like to upload changes, first clear your kernal and its outputs, then upload. In contrast, if you would like the output to be saved as well, upload the file without clearing the kernal.
